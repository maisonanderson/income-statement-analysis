# income-statement-analysis

This program takes any company's www.morningstar.com income statement as an excel file, and generates a .pdf report with graphs and ratios. Simply run the program and follow the instructions that are printed from the main() function.

These excel files must be in .xlsx format and until improvements are made, the income statements must be for the years 2016 through 2020. Functioning example files have been uploaded for use. The outputted report is also very basic in it's current state and will be significantly improved in the future.
