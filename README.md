# income-statement-analysis

This project takes www.morningstar.com income statement excel files as inputs, and generates a .pdf report with graphs and ratios. Simply run the program and follow the instructions that are printed from the main() function.

These excel files must be .xlsx and until improvements are made, the income statements must be for the years 2016 through 2020.
